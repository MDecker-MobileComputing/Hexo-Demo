## Working with the Hexo project ##

<br>

After cloning of this repository you have to call `npm install` to fetch the dependencies defined in file `package.json`.

Further, you need a global installation of *Hexo*: `npm install -g hexo-cli`

The you can start the preview of the site: `hexo server`

To generate the web content, call the following command: `hexo generate`
Please note: In file [_config.yml](_config.yml) the output folder was changed from `public/` to `docs/` (see key `public_dir`).
The reason for this was to enable simple serving of the generated web content with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

<br>

The source files for the articles and pages written in Markdown syntax can be found in folder [source/](source).
